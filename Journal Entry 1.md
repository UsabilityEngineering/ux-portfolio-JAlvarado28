### Gaming on a Second Monitor 

## by Jesus Alvarado ~ 03/07/2021

# Goals:

  -Connect to a second display whether it be a monitor or a tv. 
  
  -Set up the sound to be heard from the second display.
  
  -Set the correct resolution and play games on the second display.
  
 **memorable:** Should be easy to remember and be able to apply it with any other system such as windows or apple. 
 
 **error tolerant:** Should be able to fix it even when something goes wrong. Such as having the display output be stretched out or zoomed out. 

# Description:
Last week, my friends and I had a game night in the living room. We all wanted to play a horror game, but I was the only one who had such game in my laptop. I brought it out and had them connect it. They were able to extend the display, but not figure out how to play on the second display or how to get the sound to stop coming from the laptop itself.
  
 # Description of the interaction:
  1. Connect the HDMI to the ports on both the laptop and the television.
  2. The television will automatically be set as a mirrored. Then changed it to an extended display.

  3. Set the second display as primary in windows. 
  4. Start the game from steam. Make sure to make it in windowed mode or hit ALT + ENTER. 
  5. Set the resolution to fit the second display from the game itself or run it in windowed mode. 
  6. From the first display, set up the sound to the second display as it will play on the first display by default.

  7. Connect the controllers then start playing. 
    
 # Outcome
Overall, it was a fun yet stressfull situation as five people tried to search on how to set up the television to play from the laptop. What was interesting was that everyone knew how to extend the display yet we could not figure out how to drag the game to the television. After changing it to windowed mode, we could drag it to the television yet it fullscreened on the laptop as we tried to change the resolution. The process was **memorable** as we can apply this to any other situation such as getting a monitor, television, or a projector. It is an easy process once we knew how to set the television as primary. We were lucky that the system was **error tolerant** as it gave us a minute to comfirm the changes we did to the display. If it was not accepted, then it will go back to how it was previously.
