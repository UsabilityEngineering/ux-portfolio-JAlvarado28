### Adjusting the Sound and Mic Volume

## By Jesus Alvarado ~ 05/02/2021

# Goals:

  -Adjust the sound quality with the equalizer.
 
  -Adjust the volume of the microphone from the new headset.

  **Error tolerant:** Should be able to fix the sound easily without having to troubleshoot.
  
  **Effective:** The settings should be adjustable and easy to manipulate to the goal one desires.
  
  **Memorable:** It should be easy to remember and apply when using it on other systems.
  
  **Satisfying:** Should be an easy and enjoyable process for the user to go through.

# Description:
I had recently gotten this headset from best buy for gaming, music, and school. It came with a microphone and had a 7.1 surround sound. I installed the software called iCUE which is meant for Corsair’s products. With this, I aimed to adjust the sound quality for FPS gaming as well as adjust the microphone volume in which was too low for others who were not able to hear me.

# Description of the Interaction:

   2. Go into the equalizer sections and adjust the bandwidth.
   3. Save it as a preset for a specific purpose such as gaming or movies.

 -Mic Volume:
   1. Right-click on the sound icon on the right bottom corner of the screen.

   4. Adjust the level to which sounds the best.
   5. If it is still low, search “Equalizer APO” in google and download the first recommendation.
   6. It will ask for permission to run in the system and it will then install with Wizard.
   7. A prompt will appear to choose the item to equalize. Choose the device in the Capture Device section.

   8. I will then ask the user to restart the system. After restarting, go to the location the user chose to download too.
   9. Go to config which will bring up a notepad. It will display that the “Preamp” is set a -10 dB. Adjust the dB to the user’s preference. 
        - The higher it is, the louder the microphone will sound.

   10.  Go to the file and save the notepad. 


 # Outcome:

Overall, it was a stressful situation that involved troubleshooting which should not have happened. The process for the sound quality was easy and **memorable** for the user to adjust later for other purposes. It was a **satisfying** experience to have the ability to change the bandwidth of the frequency for the sound quality. To adjust the microphone volume, it was a lot more stressful as I had to resort to a third-party app. The process was simple and fast, but it was tedious to find the solution. With the use of the third-party app, Equalizer APO, it was very **effective** and very **error-tolerant**. It was easy to change the volume with the new app in which the iCUE or Window’s device manager lacked in. The latter excelled in the headset quality with its equalizer while the former is better to adjust the decibel.
